# The End of the World

The End of the World is a thought-provoking PlaygroundBook that makes you reflect about the world's situation and who you can be to improve it. It's a game where you're put in a situation where the world is about to end and you are the last hope to save the human race. But, to do so, you have to gather characters with different personalities and stereotypes to populate this new planet found on a parallel universe. You have to pick carefully your 5 companions on this mission to do not commit the same mistakes humans did destroying Earth and its nature resources. By the end of your mission, you'll know on which attributes you can work to keep helping humans and Earth to avoid this catastrophic destiny.
