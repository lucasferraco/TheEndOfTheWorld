# Congratulations!
You have just completed the mission and saved the human race!

These (on the live view) were the characteristics of yout team that you chose for building this new society.

## Now think about it for a moment:
Do we need to undertake a mission to leave Earth?
Of course not! There are still 1000 years left and we must save our planet, we must preserve it!

How about starting by exercising all these attributes you just picked?
It’s a good start and you can be an example!

Thank you for saving all of us!

I hope you've enjoyed this game as much as I enjoyed doing it!
